            p.text About Roman Mythology
            br
            p Roman mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to ancient Rome's legendary origins and religious system, as represented in the literature and visual arts of the Romans. "Roman mythology" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period.  Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism was an important theme. When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they are more concerned with ritual, augury, and institutions than with theology or cosmogony

            br
            p Carrying a trident with three prongs, Neptune rode a horse or a dolphin and ruled the sea. He was first to be recognized in Roman mythology as being associated with water around 399 BC. His wife was Salacia and his brothers were Jupiter and Pluto. The Romans also worshiped him as the god of horses, under the name Neptunus Equester. His counterpart among the Greek gods was Poseidon who formed the Greek trinity of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon.
